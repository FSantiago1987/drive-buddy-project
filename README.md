# DriveBuddy Project

DriveBuddy is a dedicated web app to help Ontario G2 and G driving license candidates and driving instructors in Ontario. DriveBuddy plays a role as a classified advertising and booking service that operates as a centralized network of G2 and G license candidates, driving instructors and related service providers, for posting local advertisements.

In the present scenario driving license candidates communicate with driving instructors through their personal references. This limits the option for driving license candidates to choose a driving lesson provider out of a list according to their preference. On the other hand comparatively new driving instructors do not have a bigger network to advertise their service to appropriate candidates.

DriveBuddy is the solution for both license candidates and driving instructors with the web based platform that provides an easy-to-use booking system for license candidates, and at the same time an advertising platform for driving instructors and relevant service providers. 

DriveBuddy even offers a driving instructor rating and feedback system for license candidates.
DriveBuddy makes the whole process much easier for license candidates to choose from a wide list of driving lesson providers based on their language, ratings, feedback, gender, years of experiences, location, vehicle and much more!.
